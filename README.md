# MultiCommander-Documentation
HTML Documentation for MultiCommander

All pages are organized under "Docs/Pages"

All Images should be places in "Docs/Images"

Currently the organization bit messy since this is an export from the old CMS system

MenuPage.html - Is the menu for accessing the page
Docs.css - is documentation specific CSS styling

Index.html - Is only used for local viewing.

# View Locally 

Make sure you have python3 install. On Windows 10+ just open a command prompt and type python3 and if you do 
not have it. Windows will open the Windows store so you can install it

Go to the local where the index.html is. and then type
python3-m http.server 8080

Then open a browser and go to http://localhost:8080
