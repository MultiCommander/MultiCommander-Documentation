# MultiCommander-Documentation
HTML Documentation for MultiCommander

All pages are organized under "Pages"

All Images should be places in "Docs"
(Currently the organization bit messy since this is an export from the old CMS system)

MenuPage.html - Is the menu for accessing the page
Docs.css - is documentation specific CSS styling

Index.html - Is only used for local viewing. And it is currently not working.
