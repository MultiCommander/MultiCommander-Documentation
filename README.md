# MultiCommander-Documentation
HTML Documentation for MultiCommander

All pages are organized under "Docs/Pages"

All Images should be places in "Docs/Images"

Currently the organization bit messy since this is an export from the old CMS system

MenuPage.html - Is the menu for accessing the page
Docs.css - is documentation specific CSS styling

Index.html - Is only used for local viewing. And it is currently not working.
             If somebody has the time to fix it. Please create a fork.
             Need to open documentation link from MenuPage locally.
