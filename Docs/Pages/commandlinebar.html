<h2>Command Line Bar</h2>
<p>The fourth line in the Main Application Layout is the <strong>Command Line Bar</strong>, shown below. This toolbar can be removed from the display by unchecking the check box in <strong>View-&gt;Toolbars</strong>.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="/Docs/Images/ToolbarCmdLineBar.png" style="width: 857px; height: 98px;" /></p>

<p>The buttons are enabled if the active extension (panel) supports back/forward/history. If the active extension does not support these commands, the buttons are disabled.</p>

<h2>1. Back</h2>

<p>Button <strong>1 </strong>tells the extension to go back one step. If this button is held down for 2 seconds, a list of previous locations that you can select from is displayed. If the active extension is an Explorer Panel it will go back to the previously visited path.</p>

<h2>2. Forward</h2>

<p>Button <strong>2 </strong>tells the extension to go forward one step. This can only be done if you have previously gone backwards. If this button is held down for 2 seconds, a list of all available forward locations is shown.</p>

<h2>3. History</h2>

<p>Button <strong>3 </strong>shows a list of the previous 40 locations that the currently active extension has visited. From this list a previous location can be accessed quickly.</p>

<div class="well">
<p>The default keyboard shortcut for Back is Alt+Left Arrow, Forward is Alt+Right Arrow and History is Alt+Down Arrow.<br />
In the Explorer Panel the Back and Forward mouse button can also be used if your mouse supports these buttons.</p>
</div>

<h2>4. Favorites Window</h2>

<p>The button shown as a <em>star </em>at the left end of the <em>Command Line</em>. Clicking the <em>star </em>button brings up the <strong>Favorites </strong>window. This window contains three sections:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<h3>Quick Paths (F1)</h3>

	<p><strong>Quick Paths </strong>are paths that can be selected by pressing <em>Ctrl+num</em>. There can be only 10 <em>Quick Paths </em>defined.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<h3>Favorites (F2)</h3>

	<p><strong>Favorites </strong>are paths that can be defined and stored as a list. To select a Favorite path, simply select it and press Enter.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<h3>Web (F3)</h3>

	<p><strong>Web </strong>paths are URLs that can be defined in a list of web addresses. To select a web address, simply select it and press Enter.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Command Line field</h2>

<p>The Command Line field (number <strong>5</strong>) allows you to enter commands for the active extension or plug-in. If the extension or plug-in does not handle the command it is sent to Windows to handle. If the command is a filename and is sent to Windows to be handled, Windows will launch that program. If the command is a URL, a browser is opened for it.</p>

<p>If you type a command for Windows to launch, you can insert a "*" in front of it to run it as Administrator. For example, <strong>"*cmd" </strong>will launch the command prompt as Administrator.</p>

<p>The Explorer Panel supports commands such as the command prompt's<strong> "cd" </strong>command. Thus if an Explorer Panel is currently active you can type <strong>"cd .." </strong>, <strong>"mkdir myfolder" </strong>and the Explorer Panel will create this folder.</p>

<h3>Special Internal Commands</h3>
