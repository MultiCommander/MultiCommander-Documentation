<h2>Copy/Move using Presets</h2>
<p>Creating a <strong>preset</strong> is heplful if you frequently copy or move files from/to the same locations and are using filters or other settings that are not set by default.&nbsp;The preset&nbsp;will store those settings for you, and you can load&nbsp;that preset&nbsp;with a simple press of a button (F1 to F10 ).&nbsp; If you&nbsp;always want to load the preset when you start a copy or move from a certain path, you can make the preset auto-load and you do not even have to press a button to load it.</p>

<p>To create a preset begin your normal process of copying/moving the file. Set the <strong>filter</strong> and <strong>FileOperations plug-in </strong>and other <strong>options </strong>you want to use. Then expand the dialog to its maximum size and click on <strong>Set/Change Preset.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Select a free <strong>Presets </strong>slot and enter the name you want to use for the preset. Then check the options you want the preset to store.</p>

<p>You can also check the option to "<strong>Set Target Location to...</strong>" if you want the preset to store the target location and always set that location as target no matter what path you had as target when you started the copy/move process.</p>

<p>If you want to <strong>Autoload</strong> the preset, you need to add the source path it should be connected to. <em>(Wildcard for the path is supported.)</em><br />

<p>In this example you will see that we have a preset that we named "<strong>Pictures</strong>", and we wish it to store all the Copy/Move <strong>Options</strong>, <strong>Filters </strong>and <strong>FileOperation plugins </strong>that we defined previously (before going into this dialog). We also want the target path to always be set to "<strong>E:\Pictures\</strong>" and the preset to be auto-loaded when we start a copy/move operation from "<strong>D:\Pictures\</strong>".</p>

<p>When you enter the Copy/Move dialog to start a copy/move operation and a preset is auto-loaded, you can unload the preset with <strong>F12 </strong>or press the "<strong>Unload Preset</strong>" button that appears next to the OK button. <em>(not shown in screenshots)</em></p>
