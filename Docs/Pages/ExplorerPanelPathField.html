<h2>Path Field</h2>

<p>The Path Field shows the current path displayed in the active Explorer Panel . Sub folders in the path that is shown are clickable. Clicking on a subpath causes the Explorer Panel to try to change to that path.</p>

<p>If you hold down the <strong>CTRL </strong>key while clicking on a sub folder a list of all the sub-folders under that path will be shown. You can then select a sub-folder that you want to go to from that list.</p>

<div class="specialfeature">
<p>A special feature is that if you hold down both <strong>SHIFT</strong> and <strong>CTRL</strong> keys while clicking on a sub-folder in the path field, and then select a sub folder from the folder list, it will try to go to the same sub-path under that folder as the one in which you are currently located. Eg. if you are currently located in the path <strong>"D:\Projects\MyApp\Version_1.0.0\Source\Includes\"</strong> and you click on the <strong>"MyApp"</strong> sub path while holding down <strong>Shift+Ctrl</strong>, then in the folder list that is shown you Select <strong>"Version_2.0.0"</strong>, it will try to go to "D:\Projects\MyApp\<strong>Version_2.0.0</strong>\Source\Includes\". If that path does not exist it will go to the closest path that does exist.</p>
