<div class="dochints">
<fieldset><legend>Shortcuts</legend>

<p>Alt+F6 - Unpack selected files</p>
</fieldset>
</div>

<p>A dialog will be shown where you can choose where the file should be unpacked. By default the path in the target panel is selected.<br />
You can easily toggle between the source and target path by pressing the source/target buttons.</p>

<p>If the files are unpacked into the same folder they are located in (source folder) then they will be be unpacked into a folder with the same name as the packed file, but with no file extensions.</p>

<p>For example if you unpack <em>c:\temp\myfile.zip</em> into <em>c:\temp</em> then it will be unpacked into <em>c:\temp\myfile\</em></p>

<h3><strong>Filter</strong></h3>

<p>It is also possible to specify a <b>filter</b>. The filter will exclude and/or include files/folders from the unpacking. The filter works the same as the filter for file copy.</p>
