<h2>Send to Clipboard</h2>
<p>Selecting <strong>To Clipboard</strong> under the Tools menu opens a submenu that allows you to select and copy various file properties directly to the clipboard. You then can paste that information wherever you wish.</p>

<p>Properties for all selected files/folders will be sent to the clipboard. If no files/folders are selected the file/folder in focus will be used.</p>

<p>Which properties to send depends on which command you select. The most commonly-used are the full path including filename or just the filename of the selected files or folders.</p>

<p>The default keyboard shortcut for copying the complete path is <strong>Ctrl+P</strong><br />
For copying only the file/folder name it is <strong>Shift+Ctrl+P</strong></p>

</div>

<p>Send to Clipboard is also available on the toolbar and when clicked, the complete paths of selected files/folders are copied to the clipboard.<br />
If the right mouse button is pressed on the toolbar button a popup menu with the other options is shown.</p>
