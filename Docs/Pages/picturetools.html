<p>Under the Tools menu is a <strong>Picture Tools</strong> option that opens a submenu containing the following options:</p>

<h2><strong>Convert Picture Format...</strong></h2>

<p>This converts all selected picture files into a specified format.</p>

<p>Supported target picture formats are: <em>JPEG</em>, <em>PNG</em> and <em>Bitmap (BMP)</em>.</p>

<p>Options that may be selected allow you to delete the original file if successful, and/or overwrite if the target file already exists.</p>

<h3>Auto Rotate</h3>

<p><strong>Auto Rotate</strong> reads the <em>EXIF</em> information from the picture file; if orientation information is present the image is rotated according to that information.</p>

<h3>Lossless JPEG Rotation</h3>

<p>If a picture's height and width are divisible by 16 then it is possible to rotate the image without re-encoding it and without loss of quality. If the option <b>Only do lossless rotation on JPG</b> is enabled it will rotate pictures only if it is possible to do so without quality loss; otherwise it will skip rotating that picture.</p>

<h2><strong>Strip EXIF Information</strong></h2>

<p>Removes all <em>EXIF</em> information from the selected picture files.</p>

<h2><strong>Export EXIF Information</strong></h2>

<p>Exports all <em>EXIF</em> information from the selected pictures into text files. The text files will have the same name as the picture files but with 'EXIF-data' appended to them.</p>
