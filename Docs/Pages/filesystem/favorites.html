<p>Accessing the favorites from the filesystem you can you drag and drop to add new favorites or to copy files to another target as a favorite.</p>

<p>Drag a file/folder and drop it on an empty space or on another section to place a favorite there.</p>

<p>Drag a file/folder and drop it on a existing favorite and a copy operation of the dragged files to that favorites target location will be started</p>
