<p>A new .sfv or .md5 item will be created and named "Untitled sfv file.sfv" for .sfv by default. To change the name you need to click to edit it. If the name is not changed, a new name will automatically be generated from the name of the first file that is added to this checksum file.</p>

<h2>Add Files</h2>

<p>Add files to the checksum file by using the "copy" command or drag and drop the files you want to add.<br />
<small>(The default keyboard shortcut for copy is F5 if using CommanderStyle setup, or F2 for WindowsExplorer style.)</small></p>

The checksum for all the files will now be calculated and saved into the checksum file you specified.</p>
