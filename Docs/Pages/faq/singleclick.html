<h2>FAQ - Enter Folder on Single Click</h2>
<div>
<p>Because there are so many configuration options in Multi Commander there is no single option you can check to enable this behaviour.</p>

<p>But because the mouse and keyboard are both very customizable, it is possible to configure it.</p>

<p>You can configure what should happen when you click with a mouse button and how things should work.</p>

<p>To enable single-clicking, the settings in Explorer Panel need to be modified.</p>

<p>The first thing to change is what should happen when left mouse button is clicked.</p>

<p>Changing this to "Open Folder / Execute file" will allow a folder to be opened with single click, and a file will be run on single click.</p>

<p>A potential problem is that it will be harder to select files and/or folders: normally a file or folder is selected when clicked on.</p>

<p>By enabling "Automatically select file/folder when hovering over it", the item under the mouse cursor is automatically selected.<br />
It is thus easier to select items.</p>

<p>Multi selection, however, is more difficult.</p>

<p>But enabling "Checkbox" under "<strong>Selection and Checking of Items</strong>", it will be easier to select multiple files and folders.</p>

<h2>Optional</h2>

<p>Many users like to use the single-click setup and prefer that clicking on empty space will go back to the parent item.</p>

<p>And there is an option for that:</p>

<p>(Where whitespace is the area on a row after any text).</p>
