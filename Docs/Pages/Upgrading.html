<h2>Upgrading</h2>

<h2>Update Tool</h2>

<p>When Multi Commander starts, it automatically checks for new versions. If an update is available, you will be prompted to upgrade. You can also check manually by selecting <strong>Menu &gt; Help &gt; Check for Updates</strong> or launch the update tool directly via <strong>Menu &gt; Help &gt; Launch MultiUpdate</strong>.</p>

<p>You can manually start the update tool by running <strong>MultiUpdate.exe</strong> from the installation folder of Multi Commander.</p>

<p>The update tool downloads the correct update package and replaces the necessary files. This process works for both installed and portable versions.</p>

<p>Make sure to close all running instances of Multi Commander before running the update tool. It <strong>cannot</strong> replace files that are in use. If Multi Commander is minimized to the system tray, closing the window using the 'X' button does not fully close it. To exit completely, right-click the tray icon and choose <strong>Close Multi Commander</strong>.</p>

<p>
  The update tool can also (optionally) download beta versions. If you encounter issues, you can access advanced options within the tool.<br />
  For more information, refer to the <a href="#docs_MultiUpdate">MultiUpdate documentation</a>.
</p>

<h2>Upgrade Using Installer</h2>

<p>
  You can also upgrade by downloading and running the installer package. If the installer detects an existing installation of Multi Commander, it will offer two options:<br />
  <strong>Upgrade installation</strong> or <strong>Uninstall installation</strong>.

<p>Selecting <strong>Upgrade</strong> will replace all the necessary files with updated versions, ensuring your installation is up to date.</p>
