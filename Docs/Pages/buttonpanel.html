<h2>Button Panel</h2>
<p><img alt="" src="/Docs/Images/ButtonPanel_Normal.png" style="width: 750px; height: 102px;" /></p>

<p>The button panel is shown at the bottom of the main program screen. All of these buttons can be customized in the <a href="#docs_button-editor">Button Editor</a></p>

<p>A button can be configured to change the location that an Explorer panel is showing or to call an internal or external command or script.<br />
Since the button panel can run any of the built-in scripts, buttons customization can be a very powerful tool.</p>

<p>By default there are 4 rows of button and 8 button per row, every button can have 4 actions assigned to it giving you up to 128 commands for easy access.<br />
The number of rows can also be change from 1 to 6 and the entire Button Panel can also be disabled.</p>

<p>When holding Ctrl, Shift or Ctrl+Shift (or having the Right or Middle mouse button pressed) the button panel is switched to its alternative buttons. This allows easy access to the alternative button functions.</p>

<p>If alternative buttons are not used they can be disabled in settings.</p>

<p><strong>Option - Alternative Button</strong><br />
The first two button panel options enable/disable the switching of the button panel to show the alternative button actions.<br />
NB: If both if these options are disabled there is no way to access the alternative button actions.</p>

<p><strong>Option - Transparent/Flat</strong><br />
The Transparent option will remove the button background and make the button transparent, giving a "flat" look.</p>
