<h2>Copy/Move files and folders using Filters</h2>
<p>When copying or moving files and folders you can use a <strong>filter</strong> to limit the files and folders that should be processed.</p>

<p>If a filter should match a folder then prefix the filter with a slash "/" and if you want to exclude any files prefix it with a hyphen "-". If a folder should be excluded type the hyphen first ( eg "<strong>-/MyFolder</strong>" )</p>

<p><strong>Example #1</strong><br />
<em>A number of folders were selected and we chose to copy them to E:\Pictures\. Using filters we also specify that we only want to copy the <strong>*.jpg</strong> files. We also select the AutoSort plugin so the files will be stored in A-Z named folders.</em></p>

<p><strong>Example #2</strong><br />
<em>Some folders have been selected and we chose to copy them to E:\Pictures\. In filters we also specify that we want to include all files (<strong>*.*</strong>) but we want to exclude the folder named <strong>Japan</strong> and all *.<strong>tiff</strong> files.</em></p>
