<div class="alert alert-info">
	<p><strong>Note:</strong> Not all features are available on all operating systems. Some advanced functionality may require newer Windows versions to operate properly.</p>
</div>

<h3>Hardware Requirements</h3>

<h4>Minimum Requirements</h4>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Processor:</strong> 32-bit CPU with SSE2 support (most processors from 2003 and later)</li>
	<li><strong>Memory (RAM):</strong> 512 MB minimum, 1 GB or more recommended</li>
	<li><strong>Storage:</strong> 50 MB of free disk space for installation</li>
	<li><strong>Screen Resolution:</strong> 800x600 minimum (1024x768 or higher recommended)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Recommended Requirements</h4>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Processor:</strong> 64-bit Modern multi-core processor (for better performance with large file operations)</li>
	<li><strong>Memory (RAM):</strong> 2 GB or more (especially when working with large files or archives)</li>
	<li><strong>Storage:</strong> SSD for improved file operation performance</li>
	<li><strong>Screen Resolution:</strong> 1920x1080 or higher (for optimal dual-panel layout experience)</li>

<ul>
	<li><strong>32-bit Edition:</strong> Compatible with both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows systems</li>
	<li><strong>64-bit Edition:</strong> Optimized for 64-bit Windows systems, offering better performance and memory handling for large operations</li>
</ul>

<div class="alert alert-success">
	<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Use the 64-bit edition if you're running a 64-bit version of Windows for optimal performance, especially when working with large files or performing intensive file operations.</p>
</div>

<h3>Additional Considerations</h3>

<h4>Network Requirements</h4>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Internet Connection:</strong> Optional, but recommended for automatic updates and crash reporting</li>
	<li><strong>Network Access:</strong> Required for FTP/SFTP functionality and network drive access</li>
</ul>

<h4>Permissions</h4>
<ul>
	<li><strong>User Account:</strong> Standard user account sufficient for normal operation</li>
	<li><strong>Administrator Rights:</strong> Required only for accessing system-protected areas</li>
	<li><strong>Registry Access:</strong> Required for using the Registry filesystem plugin</li>
</ul>

<h4>File System Support</h4>
<p>Multi Commander works with all Windows-supported file systems:</p>
<ul>
	<li>NTFS/ReFS (recommended for full feature support)</li>
	<li>FAT32</li>
	<li>exFAT</li>
	<li>Network file systems (SMB/CIFS)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Performance Notes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Multi Commander is designed to be lightweight and efficient, with minimal impact on system resources</li>
	<li>Memory usage scales with the number of files being displayed and operations being performed</li>
	<li>The built-in file viewer can handle extremely large text files (gigabytes) with minimal memory usage</li>
	<li>Background file operations allow continued work while copying or moving large amounts of data</li>
</ul>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
	<p><strong>Important:</strong> While Multi Commander can run on the minimum requirements, performance will be significantly better on systems that meet or exceed the recommended specifications, especially when working with large file collections or performing intensive operations.</p>
