<p>The following options are available:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<h2>Delete to Recycle Bin</h2>

	<p>When checked, the selected files and folders are moved to the Recycle Bin and can be recovered if needed. When deleting files inside an archive or on a network device, this option will be disabled and cannot be selected.<br />
	It is possible to configure if this should be enabled/disable by default under Menu -&gt; Configuration -&gt; Core Settings..<br />
	Holding the shift key down before this window is shown. (Eg pressing Shift+Del), will toggle the Recyle Bin option.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<h2>Only Files</h2>

	<p>If checked, only files are deleted. Files in folders will be deleted but the empty folders will remain on the filesystem.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<h2>Junctions and Symbolic Links</h2>

	<p>This section controls how Multi Commander should react when it finds Junctions and Symbolic Links. The recommendation is to ignore or remove the link (if permissions allow it).<br />
	It is <strong>not</strong> recommended to set <strong>Follow links</strong>, which should be used only if you really know what you are doing. A warning is shown if that option is selected.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
