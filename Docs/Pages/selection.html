<p>Under the <strong>Edit</strong> menu there are a number of special commands for selecting files and folders.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="/Docs/Images/selections.png" /></p>

<h2>Select using filters</h2>

<p>The <strong>Select </strong>and<strong> Unselect</strong> options show a select/unselect dialog where you select files using filters. You can enter a <strong>wildcard</strong> filter to select/unselect files, eg. "*.jpg *.tiff" for all jpg and tiff files.&nbsp; Separate multiple filers with a space.</p>

<h2>Save/Load Selection to/from File or Memory</h2>

<p><strong>Save selection to file</strong> will save all the selected files to a filename you specify. You can then load that file and recover all of your selections at any time.</p>

<p><strong>Load selection from file</strong> will load a file and treat every line in that file as a selection filter. Each line can be an exact match for a file/folder that you want to select or it can be a selection filter containing wildcards.</p>

<p><strong>Save/Load to/from memory</strong> options work the same way but will not survive a restart of Multi Commander.</p>

<h2>Compare Folders</h2>

<p><strong>Compare Folders</strong> will compare the paths in the source and target panel and select differences depending on which compare command is called</p>

<p>It is possible to enable or disable whether the compare command should work on only files or only folders.</p>

<h3>Compare Folders, Select Newest/Missing</h3>

<p>Will select the files that are missing in the other panel or, if folders/files are found in both panels, the newest file/folder is selected</p>

<h3>Compare Folders, Select Missing</h3>

<p>Will select only the files that are missing from the other panel.</p>

<h3>Compare Folders, Select Newest</h3>

<p>Will find files/folder that exist in both panels and select only the newest of them.</p>

<h3>Compare Folders, Select Duplicates</h3>

<p>Will select only files/folders that exist in both panels.</p>

<h3>Compare Folders, Select Selected</h3>

<p>The files that are currently selected in the source panel will also be selected in the target panel if they exist.</p>
