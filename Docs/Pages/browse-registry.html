<h2>FileSystem - FS-Reg (REG:)</h2>
<p>The virtual filesystem device extension <b>FS-Reg (REG:)</b> allows the Windows Registry to be accessed as a filesystem under the device path REG:</p>

<p>Since Multi Commander treats it as a file system most things you can do in a filesystem can be done in the Windows Registry.</p>

<p>To browse the registry you select "Windows Registry" from the device list dropdown, or you can type in a registry path in the command line field e.g. "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\" and it will go to the path you specified. You can also type REG: if you want to browse to the registry location yourself.</p>

<p>When you create a <strong><em>new folder </em></strong>in the registry you are actually creating a new registry key. You can also <strong>Delete</strong> keys and values or <strong>Rename </strong>them. You are able to <strong>copy </strong>keys and values from one place in the registry to another and you can also copy keys and values to&nbsp;disk where they will be represented as folders and files. You can also copy them back from the filesystem to the Registry.</p>

<h2>Create New Value</h2>

<p>Select what type of value you want to add from the context menu (<em>normally triggered by the right mouse button or the context menu key on your keyboard</em>).</p>

<h2>Export Values</h2>

<p>Selecting <em>export</em> from the context menu will allow you to export registry values to a standard <em>.reg</em> file. The difference between this and&nbsp; the export function in Windows' Registry editor is that here it will only export the values that you have selected. You do not need to export the entire key contents.</p>
