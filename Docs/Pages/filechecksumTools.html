<h3>Verify .sfv/.md5 Checksum files (Scans Selected Folders)</h3>

<p>This will scan all selected folder recursively for .sfv/.md5 checksum files. It will then start the File Checksum Extension in the opposite panel and add to it all the .sfv/.md5 files that are found. It will then automatically start a verify process of the added checksum files.</p>

<h3>Create .sfv checksums file</h3>

<p>This will start the File Checksum Extension in the opposite panel and automatically add all the selected files to a new file checksum of .SFV (CRC32) type.</p>

<h3>Create .md5 checksums file</h3>

<p>This will start the FileChecksum extension in the opposite panel and automatically add all the selected files to a new file checksum of MD5 type.</p>

<h3>Compare content of two files</h3>

<p>This will compare the content of two files by by calculating checksum values. It will take the first selected from the source panel and the first selected file from the target panel and compare them.</p>

<h3>Calculate checksum value from file</h3>

<p>This will calculate all supported checksum values for the selected file.<br />
It will calculate CRC32, MD5 and SHA1 values. If you enter a checksum value in the input field it will compare that value aginst the calcuated values and if a match is found the appropriate field will turn green.</p>
