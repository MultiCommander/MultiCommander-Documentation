<h2>Status Bar</h2>
<p><img alt="" src="/Docs/Images/StatusBar.png" /></p>

<p>At the very bottom of the Multi Commander window is an area where the application can show status information about background tasks like folder sizing, copy operations and more.</p>

<p>The progress status for copy/delete/move operation is shown to the right in the status bar area. If you double-click on the progressbar the progress dialog window for that operation will be brought to the foreground and shown.</p>

<p>When Administrator Mode is active you will see an indication of that in the status bar. Administrator Mode will turn itself off when it has been idle for a couple of minutes, but if you right-click on the status text for it a popup menu will be shown where you can turn off Administrator Mode without waiting.</p>
