<ol>
	<li>Select "Calculate folder size" under the Tool menu</li>

<p>Size calculation will be performed on all the selected folders. If no folders are selected then the size of all folders will be calculated.</p>

<p>Selecting folders with the <strong>space-key </strong>will automatically calculate the size of those folders.</p>

<p>The size calculation is done in the background and can be aborted by pressing the <strong>ESC</strong> key.</p>

<p>If a folder's size has been calculated, and files are <strong>deleted</strong> from that folder from within Multi Commander, the folder size will be automatically recalculated and updated.</p>

<p>The default shortcut key for calculating folder sizes is <strong>Shift+Alt+Return</strong>.</p>
