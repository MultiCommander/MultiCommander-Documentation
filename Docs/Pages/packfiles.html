<h2>Pack Files</h2>
<p>To pack files/folders into an archive you first need to select the files and folders you want to pack.</p>

<p>To start a pack operation, either press the shortcut (default Alt+F5 if running with Commander-style&nbsp; setup) or select "Pack files..." from the File menu.</p>

From the Pack Files dialog you can select which packer profile you want to use. Different profiles can use a different packer with a different default configuration.</p>

<p>To reconfigure a profile, press the "<strong>Configure</strong>" button. You can then configure the selected Packer Profile, eg. change compression levels and whatever other options that packer supports.</p>

<p>Press "<strong>Manage Profiles</strong>" to Create or Delete Packer profiles.</p>

<h2>Source (Button)</h2>

<p>This button changes the source path for the packed file to the path of the source Explorer Panel.</p>

<h2>Target (Button)</h2>

<p>This button changes the target path for the packed file to the path of the target Explorer Panel.</p>

<h2>Pack folders into individual files</h2>

<p>When this is checked, each of the selected folders will have its files packed into a separate archive file (using the source folder name as its filename). Otherwise, the selected folders will be combined into a single archive file. They will <strong>not</strong> be packed individually.</p>

<h2>Filter</h2>

<p>You can specify Filters to include and/or exclude files/folders when packing. These filters work the same as filters in the Copy/Move options <a href="#docs_copymove_operation#filter">here</a>.</p>
