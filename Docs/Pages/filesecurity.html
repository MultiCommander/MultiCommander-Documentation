<p>Under the Tools menu is a <strong>File Security</strong> entry with which you can change permissions for files and folders.<br />
This function requires Administarator permission to operate, so you may need to run Multi Commander as an Administrator.</p>

<p>The File Security submenu provides the following options:</p>

<h2>Take Ownership</h2>

<p>Allows you become the owner of the selected files and folders.</p>

<h2>Remove all permissions</h2>

<p>This removes permissions for all users and groups from the selected files and folders. Note: <em>no-one will have access to the files after this change</em>. Use the <em>Add Permissions</em> command to add permission for yourself and/or others if needed.</p>

<h2>Add Permissions</h2>

<p>This adds permissions for users to the selected files and folders. You can easily add read-only access or read/write or full-control.</p>

<p>If you want to give everyone access to a file/folder you can add read/write or full-control access to the group <b>Everyone</b> for the selected files/folders.</p>
