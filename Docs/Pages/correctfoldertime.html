<h2>Correct Folder Date/Time</h2>
<p>The date/time of a folder is changed whenever you copy a file into it, delete a file from it, or change a file in it. In some situations this may not be what you want.</p>

<p>For example, you might list and sort those folder by date, and you want the date/time of the folder to show the date/time of the most recent file in that folder rather than when something was last changed in the folder.</p>

<p>This tool will scan the selected folder and subfolders and set the date/time of the folders to that of the most recent file it finds.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Select the folder you want to change then select "Correct folder date/time" from the Tools menu.<br />

<p>You can specify two kind of filters for the scanning: Ignore and Include filters.</p>

<h2>Ignore Filter</h2>

<p>The first filter is the <em>ignore</em> filter. It specifies the files and folders that you want to ignore when finding the most recent date/time.<br />
If you enter *.txt here. It will ignore all *.txt files, even if they have a date/time that is more recent than other files.</p>

<h2>Include Filter</h2>

<p>If you specify an <em>include</em> filter then only files matching this filter will be checked. Eg. if you enter *.jpg here it will only check the date/time on *.jpg files.</p>
