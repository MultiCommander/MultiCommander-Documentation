<h2>Change File Properties</h2>
<p>Attributes and Date/Times of files and folders can be changed from the Change attributes dialog.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="/Docs/Images/ChangeFileAttributes.png" /></p>

<p>Select the files or folders whose properties you want to change, then select "Change Properties (Attributes/Time)..." under the Tools menu.</p>

<p>Multiple files and folders can be changed at once. It is also possible to change all the files in folders and sub-folders.</p>

<p>Each attribute checkbox can have one of&nbsp; 3 states:</p>

<p>If <strong>Unchecked, </strong>the attribute will be turned off.</p>

<p>If <strong>Checked</strong>, the attribute will be turned on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If <strong>Blocked</strong> (as 'Archive' and 'System', seen in the image above), the attribute will not be changed: the current attribute will be kept.</p>

<div class="well">
<p>If you hold down <strong>CTRL</strong> and <strong>Double Click</strong> in the date or attribute column for a file/folder, the Change attributes window will be shown, but <em>only </em>for that file/folder, even if multiple files are selected.</p>
</div>
