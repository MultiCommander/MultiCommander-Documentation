<h2>Change To Windows Explorer Look and Feel </h2>
<p>Multi Commander by default uses the popular Commander-Style mouse and keyboard layout.</p>

<p>Users who have never used this style before might feel more comfortable with the way <strong>Windows Explorer</strong> works. Since Multi Commander is very configurable it can be changed to look and feel like Windows Explorer. That can be tedious work because there is a lot of configuration that needs to be changed. However, the <strong>Quick Look'n'Feel Setup </strong>makes it possible to change this quickly and easily.</p>

<p>To access this, select "<strong>Quick Look'n'Feel Setup</strong>" from the <strong>Configuration</strong> menu.</p>
