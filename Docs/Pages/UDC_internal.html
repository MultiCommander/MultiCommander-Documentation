<h2>User Defined Commands - Internal Commands</h2>
<p><strong>Internal commands</strong> are commands that Multi Commander or an Extension or Plug-in has provided. For example, the menu and tool bars use these commands.&nbsp;They are simple commands that just tell Multi Commander or the Extension that the command has been called, and no parameters or customization for that command can be added.</p>

<p>One reason to create a User Defined Command that uses <em>internal commands</em> is to create an <em>alias</em> for that command so you can call that command from the command line bar. Another use would be to assign that command to a button on the button panel.</p>

<p>The command might also be something that is not normally visible in the menu bar, but you would like to put it there. In this case, you can create a User Defined Command that calls the internal command, then add the User Defined Command to the menu bar using the <em>User Menu</em> Configuration.</p>
