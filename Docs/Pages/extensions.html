<h2>Extensions and Plug-ins</h2>
<p>Multi Commander is built around <strong>extensions</strong> and <strong>plug-ins</strong>.<br />
Some of the extension are built directly into Multi Commander and some of them are located as external DLL&nbsp;files.</p>

<p>This allows for Multi Commander to grow with new features in an easy way and for other developers to create plugins to extend Multi Commander.</p>

<p>With the <strong>Manage Plugins and Extensions</strong> selection in the <em>Configuration</em> menu you can enable and disable extensions and plugins.</p>

<p>There are 4 types of extensions and plug-ins:</p>

<h3>Application Extensions</h3>

<p>These are extensions that have GUIs and create new tabs with functions in Multi Commander. Examples of Application Extensions are the Explorer Panel and File Search.</p>

<h3>FileSystem Plug-ins</h3>

<p>All filesystems and archives that Multi Commander supports are handled by plug-ins. There are plug-ins for Zip, 7-Zip, RAR, FTP and the Registry.</p>

<h3>File Operations Plug-ins</h3>

<p>These are plug-ins that are used when copying and moving files. These plug-ins can change how and where files are read and written.</p>

<h3>FileProperties Plug-ins</h3>

<p>These plug-ins allow for more data to be shown about files in new columns in the Explorer Panel. For Example the filesystem plug-in FS-Registry also has a FileProperties Extension allowing you to see the special registry information in the Explorer Panel.</p>

<h3>Configuration of Virtual FileSystem Plug-ins</h3>
