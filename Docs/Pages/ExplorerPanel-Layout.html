<h2>Explorer Panel - Layout</h2>
<p>The layout of the Explorer Panel is similar to that in otherfile managers that you may be familiar with, although it has many more features than most.<br />
Below is a description of the various parts of the display.</p>

<p>The image below shows an example of how the Explorer Panel can look with all of its user interface options enabled. Most of the user interface items can be configured and turned on/off in settings.</p>

<h3>1. Device toolbar</h3>

<p>Here you can see a list of available devices. This toolbar is very similar to the global device toolbar, except that this toolbar will only show drives. Special folders and virtual devices that the global toolbar can show is not shown in this Explorer Panel device toolbar.</p>

<p>You can enable/disable this toolbar in Explorer Panel Settings by checking/unchecking the "Drive buttons" options.</p>

<h3>2. Device Dropdown list</h3>

<p>This dropdown list shows not only drivesbut all available Devices, Special Folders, Virtual Devices. When an item in the dropdown list is selected the Explorer Panel will change to that location and show the content of the new path.<br />
For fast access to drives when the list is shown you can press (for example) the letter E to make the Explorer Panel go to the E: drive.<br />
If the <strong>SHIFT</strong> key is pressed while selecting a location, that location is then opened in a new Explorer Panel tab.</p>

<p>In settings it is possible to configure what extended location types should be shown in the dropdown list.</p>
