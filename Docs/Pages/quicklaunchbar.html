<p>The <strong>Quick Launch Bar</strong> is located after the <em>command line field</em> and the more buttons that are added the shorter the command line field will be.</p>

<p>Here is a list of some of the features of the Quick Launch bar:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>If you drop a file or folder on the Quick Launch bar area, a button for it will be automatically added for it.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>You can rearrange the buttons in the Quick Launch bar by dragging them around.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If a file is dropped on a program button, that file is sent as a parameter to the program it is dropped on. For example, if you drop a text file on the notepad button, the text file will be opened in notepad.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If you click on a folder button, that folder will be opened inside Multi Commander.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If you (left-) click on a program button, that program will be started. If you right-click on it, a menu will be opened that allows you to:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Start it normally</li>
		<li>Start it as Administrator (Vista/Win7 +)</li>
		<li>Go to the folder containing the program file</li>
		<li>Remove the button from the Quick Launch bar</li>
		<li>Customize the way the program is opened, or what icon or tooltip to show for it, etc.</li>
		<li>Insert a user-defined command button on its left</li>
		<li>Insert a separator to its left. (This lets you group Quick Launch buttons.)</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Entire Quick Launch Row</h3>

<p>To add an entire Quick Launch row, go to <em>Configuration &gt; Core Settings &gt; Application Layout &gt; Toolbars &gt; Quicklaunch bar (Entire row)</em> and click on the checkbox. (Clear the checkbox to remove the extra row.)</p>

<p>You will now have two Quick Launch Bars.</p>

<h3>Enable/Disable</h3>

<p>If the Quick Launch Bar items are unchecked under Core Settings, then they are not created or loaded during startup. But if they are checked in Core Settings, they can still be hidden if <em>Configuration &gt; Core Settings &gt; Application Layout &gt; Toolbars &gt; CommandLine Bar &gt; Quick Launch ba</em>r is unchecked.<br />
You should only use that option to temporarily hide them. If you want to permanently remove them, then uncheck them under Core Settings. If they are just hidden they are still using memory resources and are loaded and created during startup. To minimize resource usage, disable them under Core Settings.</p>
