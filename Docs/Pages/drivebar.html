<h2>Drive Bar</h2>
<p><img alt="" src="/Docs/Images/ToolbarDriveBar.png" style="width: 514px; height: 51px;" /></p>

<p>The <em>Drive toolbar </em>is the rightmost subset of the toolbar, and is displayed whenever <strong>View-&gt;Toolbars-&gt;Drives</strong> is checked and it is enabled in the Explorer Panel Settings.<br />
<br />
The Drive toolbar shows a list of drives that the user can choose from. It also show common folder locations like desktop, pictures, download and more. All the virtual filesystems (like REG, FTP: WPD: ) are also here.<br />
Clicking on one of the icons causes the current tab to switch to that location.</p>

<p>You can also right click on a drive button to show the Windows Shell Context Menu (the "Right-click" menu) for that drive.</p>

<h3>Add more buttons</h3>

<p>It is possible to configure which of the special folders and virtual devices to show on the drive toolbar.</p>

<p>To configure the drive toolbar go to  <strong>Menu -&gt; Configuration -&gt; Explorer Panel Settings </strong>and click on the <strong>Layout </strong>tab</p>

<p>If you enable all of them the toolbar might grow very long and the system will try to auto-rearrange it to its own line if it does not fit in the Window.<br />
On some systems this causes the toolbar area to rearrange itself incorrectly and may look unsightly.<br />
This can be avoided if, in settings, you allow the drive toolbar to be placed on its own line.</p>

<p>Enabling this option causes the drive toolbar to be placed on its own line and, if there are many drive buttons, they will fit better.</p>

<h2>Drivebar Inside Explorer Panel</h2>

<p>It is also possible to place the drivebar inside an Explorer Panel.<br />
This is enabled by checking the option "Drive buttons" under the "Explorer Panel toolbars" section</p>

<p><img alt="" src="/Docs/Images/Toolbar_drivebar_inside_explorerpanel_option.png" /></p>

<p>There will now be a drive buttons bar inside the Explorer Panel.</p>

<p><em>note that the drive bar inside an Explorer Panel is limited in that it does not support showing special folders or virtual devices.</em></p>

<h3>Other Configuration</h3>

<p>If you have a drive bar active (application global or inside an Explorer Panel) you can remove the Device Dropdown list. However, if you are a user who likes to use hotkeys for fast access then this is not recommended.</p>
