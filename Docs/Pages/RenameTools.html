<p>These Rename commands are performed on all selected files and folders.</p>

<p><strong>Uppercase / Lowercase</strong> renames the selected files/folders to the same name but with all uppercase or all lowercase letters.</p>

<p><strong>Capitalize</strong> renames all selected files and folders to lowercase, with only the first letter in each word uppercase. A word is defined as a string of characters preceded by space, dot or underscore.</p>

<p><strong>Replace text in name</strong> will replace a substring in all the selected file/folder names with other text.</p>

<p><strong>Similar name, different extension</strong> is a special rename operation that will only rename selected files (<em>not</em> folders).</p>

The selected files will be renamed with the new name, but the file extensions are left unchanged.</p>

<p>Some of these tools are also availible when right clicking on the Rename button on the toolbar</p>
