<h2>Paste from Clipboard into Explorer Panel</h2>
<p>If the data in the clipboard is text or picture data and you try to paste it into the Explorer Panel you will be asked to save the clipboard data as a text or image file.</p>

<h3>Saving Text Data</h3>

<p>If the data in your clipboard is <em>text </em>and you press Ctrl+V (or Menu &gt; Edit &gt; Paste) while the focus in Multi Commander is in an Explorer Panel, you will be shown a dialog where you can save the text content from the clipboard to a file.<br />
<img alt="" src="/Docs/Images/SaveClipboardText.png" /><br />
<br />
The dialog lets you choose the format to save the text in</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ascii</li>
	<li>Unicode</li>
	<li>Ascii - convert to CRLF</li>
	<li>Unicode - convert to CRLF</li>
	<li>Binary (Raw data)</li>
</ul>

<p>Some special handling is done for text data. If the text data in your clipboard looks like a <em>path</em> for an existing folder or file, then instead of opening a dialog, Multi Commander will immediately change the current location to that path you have in your clipboard data. If the path in the clipboard has a file specified then the focus will be set to that file.</p>

<h3>Saving Image Data</h3>

<p>If the clipboard data is an <em>image</em> (for example if you pressed print screen to take a screenshot), you will be given the option to select the image format to save it in.<br />
<img alt="" src="/Docs/Images/SaveClipboardImg.png" /><br />
<br />
You can save the image the following format</p>

<ul>
	<li>jpg</li>
	<li>png</li>
	<li>bmp</li>
</ul>
