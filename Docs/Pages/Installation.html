<h2>Download and Installation</h2>
<h2>Download</h2>

<p>The official download location is <a href="http://multicommander.com/downloads">http://multicommander.com/downloads</a>. If you download it from another location make certain that you really trust that source: you never know if somebody has manipulated the package.<br />
This is especially important with the portable version since the package is only a .zip. <strong>Never</strong> download the portable version from another source.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p><strong>Full Installer (.exe)</strong></p>

<p>The full installer is named <strong>MultiCommander_x64_([version]).exe </strong>or <strong>MultiCommander_win32_([version]).exe</strong></p>

<p>You will be given two choices at the beginning of the installation: <strong>Single User</strong> or <strong>All users</strong>.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="/Docs/Images/InstallModes.png" style="width: 50%; height: 50%;" /></p>

<p>If you choose <strong>Single User</strong> the installer will, by default, select an installation location that is under your private account. By doing this the installer will not require any administrator rights for the installation.</p>

<p>If you select <strong>All users</strong> the installer will, by default, select the shared Program Files folder as the install location. By installing it here <em>all </em>user accounts on the machine will have access to the program.<br />
This installation option requires administrator rights and the installer will restart itself and ask for admin permission if needed.</p>

<p>All users that then run Multi Commander will get their own configuration. The configuration is always stored under the user account, located under the <strong>Application Data Path</strong>.<br />
Eg. <strong>C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\MultiCommander\Config\</strong></p>

<p>By typing "<strong>:goconfig</strong>" in the command line field inside Multi Commander. The active Explorer Panel will then open at the Multi Commander configuration folder</p>

<p><strong>Portable Installer (.zip)</strong></p>

<p>The portable installer is named <strong>MultiCommander_x64_Portable_([version]).zip</strong> or <strong>MultiCommander_win32_Portable_([version]).zip</strong></p>

<p>The portable package is a zip archive that you only need to unpack to a folder. Just make sure that you keep the folder structure from the zip package.<br />
The portable version is the same as the installed version. The difference is that the portable version is configured to store all settings and configuration in the folder that Multi Commander is installed in and run from.<br />
The portable version does not save anything to the registry or to the user account folder. Everything is saved in the Multi Commander folder. So the program must have write permissions to the folder that you start Multi Commander from.<br />
This version is ideal to be installed to - and run from - a USB memory stick.</p>

<fieldset><legend>Note for WinPE Users</legend>

<p>If you want to use Multi Commander in WinPE 4.0, and assuming your WinPE directory is X:,<br />
copy the folowing files to the following directories <em>before </em>you build WinPE:</p>

<p>C:\Windows\System32\en-EN\oledlg.dll.mui -&gt; X:\Windows\System32\en-EN\<br />
C:\Windows\Syswow64\en-EN\oledlg.dll.mui -&gt; X:\Windows\SysWOW64\en-EN\<br />
C:\Windows\Syswow64\oledlg.dll -&gt; X:\Windows\SysWOW64\<br />
C:\Windows\System32\oledlg.dll -&gt; X:\Windows\System32\</p>
