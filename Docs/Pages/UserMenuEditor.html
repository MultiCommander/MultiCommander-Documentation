<h2>User Menu Editor</h2>
<p>To add your own <strong>User Defined Commands</strong> to the menu you need to start the Menu Customization editor from the Configuration menu.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="/Docs/Images/usermenu.png" /></p>

<p>This will list all of your User Defined Commands on the left and on the right will show your user-defined menus.</p>

<p>The menu is shown as a tree list with the top level being menus on the menu bar.</p>

<p>You can drag and drop menu items in the tree list to rearrange how you want to display items.<br />
The Add Menu button adds a new top-level menu or sub-Menu.</p>

<p>Select the User Defined Command you want to add on the left, and select under which menu you want that command added on the right. Then press the "--&gt;" to add that command to the menu tree.</p>
