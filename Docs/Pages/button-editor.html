<h2>Button Editor</h2>
<p>The Button Editor is used to change and customize the buttons on the Button Panel.</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6;">To change how the buttons in the button panel work you must open the </span><strong style="line-height: 1.6;">Button Editor</strong><span style="line-height: 1.6;"> by clicking on </span><strong style="line-height: 1.6;">Button Editor in</strong><span style="line-height: 1.6;"> the </span><strong style="line-height: 1.6;">Configuration </strong><span style="line-height: 1.6;">menu.</span></p>

<p><img alt="" src="/Docs/Images/ButtonEditor.png" /></p>

<p>When the Button Editor is shown the button panel changes to edit mode. <span style="font-weight: bold;">C</span><strong>lick on the button</strong> you want to edit. To edit a button in one of its alternative modes hold down a mouse or key modifier to toggle the button panel state to see the button you want to change. <em>(Ctrl / Shift/ Ctrl+Shift or Right/Middle mouse button).</em></p>

<p>There are six kinds of command you can create for a button. These are the same types of command that you can create in the "user defined command" window.</p>

<h2>User Defined Commands</h2>

<p>The commands listed are User Defined Commands that you have already created with the User Defined Commands dialog.</p>

<p>Select which command you want to have run when the button is clicked.</p>

<h2>Internal Commands</h2>

<p>These are Commands that are either internal to Multi Commander or are extensions (mostly commands that you find in the menu bar).</p>

<p>Two dropdowns will be shown in order. In the first select which module contains the command; in the second select the required command within the module.</p>

<h2>External Commands</h2>

<p>These are external programs to be executed.</p>

<h2>Custom Commands</h2>

<p>Custom commands are simple commands that are exposed by <strong>Multi Commander </strong>or by an <strong>Extension </strong>or<strong> Plug-in</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can also use the helper function list boxes to create the command.</p>

<p>To use them, you first select what <strong>group </strong>of functions you want to add a command from. All Extensions and Plug-ins are located in separate groups. When a group is selected the function list is updated with all functions that are available from that group. Select the <strong>function </strong>that you want to use and press the <strong>'Add' </strong>button; this will add the function to the "<strong>Command</strong>" field. Then select the<strong> option </strong>or <strong>parameter </strong>you want to add. If the parameter ends with an "<strong>=</strong>" sign, then you are required to add additional parameter information.</p>

<h2>Batch Script (.bat)</h2>

<p>This is a .bat script that will be generated and run when the button is clicked.</p>

<p>You can insert dynamic tags into the script that will be expanded when the script is generated.</p>

<h2>MultiScript</h2>

<p>This is the most advanced type of command you can create. It uses scripts that run under the Multi Commander Script Engine.&nbsp;</p>
