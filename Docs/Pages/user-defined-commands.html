<h2>Create User Defined Commands</h2>
<p>Multi Commander allows you to create your own <strong>commands</strong>, which can then be run from the <em>menubar</em>, <em>button panel</em>, a <em>hotkey </em>or the <em>command line</em>.</p>

<p>Open the User Defined Commands dialog by selecting "<strong>User Defined Commands</strong>"&nbsp;from the <strong>Configuration </strong>menu.</p>

<h2>Create Command</h2>

<p>Follow these instructions to create a command:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Click on the new button and enter the name you want to give your command. (The name can be changed later by editing the name property and re-saving the command.)</li>
	<li>Fill in the tooltip / description for the command. This text will be shown as a tooltip when you hover over a command (if the command is assigned to a button on the button panel) or as a menu entry or description when needed.</li>
	<li>Next select which type of command you want to create. There are five types of command available:
	<ol>
		<li><a href="#docs_UDC_internal">Internal Commands</a></li>
		<li><a href="#docs_UDC_external">External </a><a href="#docs_UDC_internal">Commands</a></li>
		<li><a href="#docs_UDC_custom">Custom Commands</a></li>
		<li><a href="#docs_UDC_batch">Batch Script (.BAT)</a></li>
		<li><a href="#docs_UDC_multiscript">MultiScript</a></li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>When you are done, press the <strong>Save</strong> button to save the command.</li>
	<li>You now need to assign the command to a button, hotkey, menu item or alias so you will have a way to access the command.
	<p>From the <a href="#docs_button-editor">Button Editor</a> you can configure a button to use a "User Defined Command" and then choose which of your commands to assign to it.</p>

	<p>From the Menu button you can add your command to a <em>menu item</em> that will be shown on the menu bar. The HotKey button will open the <a href="#docs_keyboard-customization">Keyboard customization</a> window with your command pre-selected so that you can assign a hotkey to it.</p>

	<p>The unique ID that is shown in the Unique ID field at the top right of the screen (generated when the command was saved) allows you to access this command from the <em>command line</em> bar. The easiest way to do that is to create an <em>alias </em>for that id with a name you can more easily remember, using the&nbsp;<a href="#docs_aliases">Alias Editor</a> (found under the <strong>Configuration </strong>menu).&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
</ol>
